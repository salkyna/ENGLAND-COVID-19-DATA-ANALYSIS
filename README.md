# ENGLAND-COVID-19-DATA-ANALYSIS

The goal of this project is to analyze England's Covid-19 status as of 6 Jul, 2021 using Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering techniques and Time Series Analysis. The project will not go further and develop any of the Machine Learning models.

Covid-19 patterns among Variants, Vaccinations, Deaths and Cases in general from the start of the pandemic (first registered case in England) will be revealed. 
Alpha and Delta Variants will be heavily observed.

Some intuitive predictions for the nearest future regarding the course of the pandemic will be given by the end of the analysis.

The directories in this repository contain 20+ raw datasets to be used in the analysis.
